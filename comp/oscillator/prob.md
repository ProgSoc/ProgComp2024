# üìè Coupled Oscillator
Given the initial positions and velocities of several objects, their masses and the [spring constants](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/hooke%27s_law) of springs between them, find the **position of m<sub>1</sub> after 5 seconds** (there is a small tolerance for answers of ¬±0.05). **Each spring is at rest at a length of 5**. The spring associated with each mass is connected to the previous one with the spring on m<sub>1</sub> being fixed to the wall at x = 0. Assume friction is negligible and the springs are connected to the centre of each mass.

## Required Formulae 
![formulea](formula.png)

To clarify:
* A spring with spring constant k<sub>1</sub> connects m<sub>1</sub> to the wall at x = 0. This means that the force on m<sub>1</sub> at any time is -k<sub>1</sub> times the position of m<sub>1</sub> (the position of one end of the spring) minus 0 (the position of the other end of the spring) minus 5 (the length at which the spring is at rest.
* The force is the same at either end of a spring. This means that both m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> (which are both connected by a spring with spring constant k<sub>2</sub>) will both experience a force of magnitude k<sub>2</sub> times the difference between 5 (the resting length of the spring) and the distance between m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> (the length of the spring at that instant) but in opposite directions.


## Input
The input is the initial positions, initial velocities, masses and spring constants of the associated spring of each mass in a comma-separated list on each line. Note that the first line is the column headings (you should be able to load this as a CSV if you would like).

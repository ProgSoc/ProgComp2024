# üìè Coupled Oscillator
Given the initial positions and velocities of several objects, their masses and the spring constants the springs between them, find the **position of $m_1$ after 5 seconds** (there is a small tolerance for answers of ¬±0.01). **Each spring is at rest at a length of 5**. The spring associated with each mass is connected to the previous one with the spring on $m_1$ being fixed to the wall at $x = 0$. Assume friction is negligible and the springs are connected to the centre of each mass.

## Required Formulae 
* $x(t) = \int v(t) \cdot \text d t = \iint a(t) \cdot \text d t$
* $a = \frac{F}{m}$
* $F = -kx$ where $x$ is the spring's displacement from it's resting position.


## Input
The input is the initial positions, initial velocities, masses and spring constants of the associated spring of each mass in a comma separated list on each line. Note that the first line is the column headings (you should be able to load this as a CSV if you would like).

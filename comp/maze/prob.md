# ðŸ§­ Maze Solver
Given the layout of a maze with **one correct route**, find the length of said route. The maze is represented by a graph where nodes are certain points in the maze and edges are paths between them. You are looking for the **number of nodes in between the start (ID = 0) and end (ID = 1)**.

## Input
Each line specifies a position in the maze. Number at the head of each line is that line's unique ID. Following the colon is a comma separated list of the IDs of all other positions in the maze with a path from that current position. **The first item in the list (with ID: 0) is the start and the second (with ID: 1) is the end**.

```
6: 1, 5
0: 5, 2
2: 0, 3
4: 3
3: 2, 4
1: 6
5: 6, 0
```

## Output
The output is the number of nodes in between the start (ID = 0) and the end (ID = 1). There is only one route between them so this solution is unique.

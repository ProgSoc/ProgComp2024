# üñ•Ô∏è Matrix Code
Given several lines of text with words written vertically across lines, extract the vertical words and output the **average length** of all words. 

## Input
Input is several lines in the following format.

```
            h       
            e     h 
      h     l     eh

The average length for this input would be `5.0`.

## Output
Output a floating point number representing the average length of all of the extracted vertical words.

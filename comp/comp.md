## Solving questions

Each question requires processing your generated problem input.

<!--
Just as an example, here's a simple python program that reads a line from standard input and then prints it out again:

line = input()
print(line)

However, we've created a scaffold for each question that does that for you to make life easier.

We've prepared scaffolds for Python, Java and C++. You should be able to write code locally, test it with the sample inputs/outputs, then upload it to the competition server when you're done to mark it.
-->

To upload a file, make sure you're logged in, then you should have a submit button on the problem page.

<!-- Click, then select your file and the question you're submitting for, and it should judge it from there. -->

## Scoring

There are 2 points that make up your score and ranking:

1. Problem points
    - These are summed,
    - The team with the most is ranked first.
    - In a tie, the second system is used:
2. Penalty Points
    - Number of minutes since competition start that you submitted, plus 20 minutes times the number of incorrect submissions.
    - The team with the least is ranked first.

## Use of AI

We will not allow using AI to do the thinking for you. However, you are allowed to use:
* GH Copilot and similar tools
* Chatbots and AI-powered search to learn about concepts you're struggling to understand
You are NOT allowed to use AI to do the questions for you. You must understand your solution to each question. *We will be checking.*

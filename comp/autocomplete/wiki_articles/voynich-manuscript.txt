the voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown script referred to as voynichese the vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early th century stylistic analysis has indicated the manuscript may have been composed in italy during the italian renaissance while the origins authorship and purpose of the manuscript are still debated hypotheses range from a script for a natural language or constructed language an unread code cypher or other form of cryptography or perhaps a hoax reference work i.e folkloric index or compendium or work of fiction e.g science fantasy or mythopoeia metafiction speculative fiction currently lacking the translation(s and context needed to both properly entertain or eliminate any of these possibilities the manuscript consists of around pages but there is evidence that pages are missing the text is written from left to right and some pages are foldable sheets of varying sizes most of the pages have fantastical illustrations and diagrams some crudely coloured with sections of the manuscript showing people fictitious plants astrological symbols etc the manuscript is named after wilfrid voynich a polish book dealer who purchased it in since it has been held in yale university's beinecke rare book and manuscript library in yale university published the manuscript online in its entirety in their digital library the voynich manuscript has been studied by both professional and amateur cryptographers including american and british codebreakers from both world war i and world war ii codebreakers prescott currier william friedman elizebeth friedman and john tiltman were unsuccessful the manuscript has never been demonstrably deciphered and none of the proposed hypotheses have been independently verified the mystery of its meaning and origin has excited speculation and provoked study description codicology the codicology or physical characteristics of the manuscript has been studied by researchers the manuscript measures by by cm by by in with hundreds of vellum pages collected into quires the total number of pages is around but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted the quires have been numbered from to in various locations using a style of numerals consistent with those used in the th century and the top righthand corner of each recto righthand page has been numbered from to using a style of numerals that originated at a later date from the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages it seems likely that in the past the manuscript had at least pages in quires some of which were already missing when wilfrid voynich acquired the manuscript in there is strong evidence that many of the book's bifolios were reordered at various points in the book's history and that its pages were originally in a different order than the order they are in today parchment covers and binding samples from various parts of the manuscript were radiocarbon dated at the university of arizona in the results were consistent for all samples tested and indicated a date for the parchment between and protein testing in revealed that the parchment was made from calfskin and multispectral analysis showed that it had not been written on before the manuscript was created i.e it is not a palimpsest the quality of the parchment is average and has deficiencies such as holes and tears common in parchment codices but was also prepared with so much care that the skin side is largely indistinguishable from the flesh side the parchment is prepared from at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins some folios such as and are thicker than the usual parchment the goat skin binding and covers are not original to the book but date to its possession by the collegio romano insect holes are present on the first and last folios of the manuscript in the current order and suggest that a wooden cover was present before the later covers discolouring on the edges points to a tanned leather inside cover ink many pages contain substantial drawings or charts which are coloured with paint based on modern analysis using polarized light microscopy plm it has been determined that a quill pen and iron gall ink were used for the text and figure outlines the ink of the drawings text and page and quire numbers have similar microscopic characteristics in energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy eds revealed that the inks contained major amounts of carbon iron sulfur potassium and calcium with trace amounts of copper and occasionally zinc eds did not show the presence of lead while x-ray diffraction xrd identified potassium lead oxide potassium hydrogen sulphate and syngenite in one of the samples tested the similarity between the drawing inks and text inks suggested a contemporaneous origin paint coloured paint was applied somewhat crudely to the ink-outlined figures possibly at a later date the blue white red-brown and green paints of the manuscript have been analysed using plm xrd eds and scanning electron microscopy sem the blue paint proved to be ground azurite with minor traces of the copper oxide cuprite the white paint is likely a mixture of egg-white and calcium carbonate the green paint is tentatively characterised by copper and copper-chlorine resinate the crystalline material might be atacamite or some other copper-chlorine compound analysis of the red-brown paint indicated a red ochre with the crystal phases hematite and iron sulfide minor amounts of lead sulfide and palmierite are possibly present in the red-brown paint the pigments used were deemed inexpensive retouching computer scientist jorge stolfi of the university of campinas highlighted that parts of the text and drawings have been modified using darker ink over a fainter earlier script evidence for this is visible in various folios for example f1r f3v f26v f57v f67r f71r f72v f72v and f73r text every page in the manuscript contains text mostly in an unidentified language but some have extraneous writing in latin script the bulk of the text in the page manuscript is written in an unknown script running left to right most of the characters are composed of one or two simple pen strokes there exists some dispute as to whether certain characters are distinct but a script of characters would account for virtually all of the text the exceptions are a few dozen rarer characters that occur only once or twice each there is no obvious punctuation much of the text is written in a single column in the body of a page with a slightly ragged right margin and paragraph divisions and sometimes with stars in the left margin other text occurs in charts or as labels associated with illustrations the ductus flows smoothly giving the impression that the symbols were not enciphered there is no delay between characters as would normally be expected in written encoded text extraneous writing only a few of the words in the manuscript are thought to have not been written in the unknown script f1r a sequence of latin letters in the right margin parallel with characters from the unknown script also the now-unreadable signature of jacobj tepenece is found in the bottom margin f17r a line of writing in the latin script in the top margin f66r a small number of words in the bottom left corner near a drawing of a nude man have been read as der mussteil a high german phrase for a widow's share f70v–f73v the astrological series of diagrams in the astronomical section has the names of ten of the months from march to december written in latin script with spelling suggestive of the medieval languages of france northwest italy or the iberian peninsula f116v four lines written in rather distorted latin script referred to as michitonese except for two words in the unknown script the words in latin script appear to be distorted with characteristics of the unknown language the lettering resembles european alphabets of the late th and th centuries but the words do not seem to make sense in any language whether these bits of latin script were part of the original text or were added later is not known transcription various transcription alphabets have been created to equate voynich characters with latin characters to help with cryptanalysis such as the extensible originally european voynich alphabet eva the first major one was created by the first study group led by cryptographer william f friedman in the s where each line of the manuscript was transcribed to an ibm punch card to make it machine readable statistical patterns the text consists of over characters with spaces dividing the text into about groups of varying length usually referred to as words or word tokens of those words are considered unique word types the structure of these words seems to follow phonological or orthographic laws of some sort for example certain characters must appear in each word like english vowels some characters never follow others or some may be doubled or tripled but others may not the distribution of letters within words is also rather peculiar some characters occur only at the beginning of a word some only at the end like greek and some always in the middle section many researchers have commented upon the highly regular structure of the words professor gonzalo rubio an expert in ancient languages at pennsylvania state university stated the things we know as grammatical markers things that occur commonly at the beginning or end of words such as s or d in our language and that are used to express grammar never appear in the middle of words in the voynich manuscript that's unheard of for any indo-european hungarian or finnish language stephan vonfelt studied statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations properties which can be vaguely characterised as rhythmic resonance alliteration or assonance and found that under that respect voynichese is more similar to the mandarin chinese pinyin text of the records of the grand historian than to the text of works from european languages although the numerical differences between voynichese and mandarin chinese pinyin look larger than those between mandarin chinese pinyin and european languages practically no words have fewer than two letters or more than ten some words occur in only certain sections or in only a few pages others occur throughout the manuscript few repetitions occur among the thousand or so labels attached to the illustrations there are instances where the same common word appears up to three times in a row see zipf's law words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency causing single-substitution alphabet decipherings to yield babble-like text in cryptanalyst elizebeth friedman described such statistical analyses as doomed to utter frustration in a team led by diego amancio of the university of são paulo published a study using statistical methods to analyse the relationships of the words in the text instead of trying to find the meaning amancio's team looked for connections and clusters of words by measuring the frequency and intermittence of words amancio claimed to identify the text's keywords and produced three-dimensional models of the text's structure and word frequencies the team concluded that in of cases the voynich systems are similar to those of other known books indicating that the text is in an actual language not random gibberish the use of the framework was exemplified with the analysis of the voynich manuscript with the final conclusion that it differs from a random sequence of words being compatible with natural languages even though our approach is not aimed at deciphering voynich it was capable of providing keywords that could be helpful for decipherers in the future linguists claire bowern and luke lindemann have applied statistical methods to the voynich manuscript comparing it to other languages and encodings of languages and have found both similarities and differences in statistical properties character sequences in languages are measured using a metric called h or second-order conditional entropy natural languages tend to have an h between and but voynichese has much more predictable character sequences and an h around however at higher levels of organisation the voynich manuscript displays properties similar to those of natural languages based on this bowern dismisses theories that the manuscript is gibberish it is likely to be an encoded natural language or a constructed language bowern also concludes that the statistical properties of the voynich manuscript are not consistent with the use of a substitution cipher or polyalphabetic cipher as noted in bowern's review multiple scribes or hands may have written the manuscript possibly using two methods of encoding at least one natural language the language voynich a appears in the herbal and pharmaceutical parts of the manuscript the language known as voynich b appears in the balneological section some parts of the medicinal and herbal sections and the astrological section the most common vocabulary items of voynich a and voynich b are substantially different topic modeling of the manuscript suggests that pages identified as written by a particular scribe may relate to a different topic in terms of morphology if visual spaces in the manuscript are assumed to indicate word breaks there are consistent patterns that suggest a three-part word structure of prefix root or midfix and suffix certain characters and character combinations are more likely to appear in particular fields there are minor variations between voynich a and voynich b the predictability of certain letters in a relatively small number of combinations in certain parts of words appears to explain the low entropy h of voynichese in the absence of obvious punctuation some variants of the same word appear to be specific to typographical positions such as the beginning of a paragraph line or sentence the voynich word frequencies of both variants appear to conform to a zipfian distribution supporting the idea that the text has linguistic meaning this has implications for the encoding methods most likely to have been used since some forms of encoding interfere with the zipfian distribution measures of the proportional frequency of the ten most common words is similar to those of the semitic iranian and germanic languages another measure of morphological complexity the moving-average type–token ratio mattr index is similar to iranian germanic and romance languages illustrations because the text cannot be read the manuscript is conventionally divided into sections based on its illustrations most of the manuscript forms six different sections each typified by illustrations with different styles and supposed subject matter except for the last section in which the only drawings are small stars in the margin the conventional sections are herbal folios each page displays one or two plants and a few paragraphs of text a format typical of european herbals of the time some parts of these drawings are larger and cleaner copies of sketches seen in the pharmaceutical section none of the plants depicted are unambiguously identifiable astronomical folios contains circular diagrams suggestive of astronomy or astrology some of them with suns moons and stars one series of diagrams depicts conventional symbols for the zodiacal constellations two fish for pisces a bull for taurus a hunter with crossbow for sagittarius etc each of these has female figures arranged in two or more concentric bands most of the females are at least partly nude and each holds what appears to be a labelled star or is shown with the star attached to either arm by what could be a tether or cord of some kind the last two pages of this section were lost aquarius and capricornus roughly february and january while aries and taurus are split into four paired diagrams with women and stars each some of these diagrams are on fold-out pages balneological folios a dense continuous text interspersed with drawings mostly showing small nude women some wearing crowns bathing in pools or tubs connected by an elaborate network of pipes the bifolio consists of folios verso and recto it forms an integrated design with water flowing from one folio to the other cosmological folios more circular diagrams but they are of an obscure nature this section also has foldouts one of them spans six pages commonly called the rosettes folio and contains a map or diagram with nine islands or rosettes connected by causeways and containing castles as well as what might be a volcano pharmaceutical folios many labelled drawings of isolated plant parts roots leaves etc objects resembling apothecary jars ranging in style from the mundane to the fantastical and a few text paragraphs recipes folios full pages of text broken into many short paragraphs each marked with a star in the left margin five folios contain only text and at least folios pages are missing from the manuscript purpose the overall impression given by the surviving leaves of the manuscript is that it was meant to serve as a pharmacopoeia or to address topics in medieval or early modern medicine however the puzzling details of the illustrations have fuelled many theories about the book's origin the contents of its text and the purpose for which it was intended the first section of the book is almost certainly herbal but attempts have failed to identify the plants either with actual specimens or with the stylised drawings of contemporaneous herbals only a few of the plant drawings can be identified with reasonable certainty such as a wild pansy and the maidenhair fern the herbal pictures that match pharmacological sketches appear to be clean copies of them except that missing parts were completed with improbable details in fact many of the plant drawings in the herbal section seem to be composite the roots of one species have been fastened to the leaves of another with flowers from a third astrological considerations frequently played a prominent role in herb gathering bloodletting and other medical procedures common during the likeliest dates of the manuscript however interpretation remains speculative apart from the obvious zodiac symbols and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets history much of the book's early provenance is unknown though the text and illustrations are all characteristically european in university of arizona researchers radiocarbon dated the manuscript's vellum to between and in addition mccrone associates in westmont illinois found that the paints in the manuscript were of materials to be expected from that period of european history there have been erroneous reports that mccrone associates indicated that much of the ink was added not long after the creation of the parchment but their official report contains no statement of this the first confirmed owner was georg baresch a th-century alchemist from prague baresch was apparently puzzled about this sphynx that had been taking up space uselessly in his library for many years he learned that jesuit scholar athanasius kircher from the collegio romano had published a coptic egyptian dictionary and claimed to have deciphered the egyptian hieroglyphs baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to kircher in rome asking for clues the letter from baresch to kircher is the earliest known mention of the manuscript to have been confirmed whether kircher answered the request or not is not known but he was apparently interested enough to try to acquire the book which baresch refused to yield upon baresch's death the manuscript passed to his friend jan marek marci also known as johannes marcus marci then rector of charles university in prague a few years later marci sent the book to kircher his longtime friend and correspondent marci also sent kircher a cover letter in latin dated august or that was still attached to the book when voynich acquired it reverend and distinguished sir father in christ this book bequeathed to me by an intimate friend i destined for you my very dear athanasius as soon as it came into my possession for i was convinced that it could be read by no one except yourself the former owner of this book asked your opinion by letter copying and sending you a portion of the book from which he believed you would be able to read the remainder but he at that time refused to send the book itself to its deciphering he devoted unflagging toil as is apparent from attempts of his which i send you herewith and he relinquished hope only with his life but his toil was in vain for such sphinxes as these obey no one but their master kircher accept now this token such as it is and long overdue though it be of my affection for you and burst through its bars if there are any with your wonted success dr raphael a tutor in the bohemian language to ferdinand iii then king of bohemia told me the said book belonged to the emperor rudolf and that he presented to the bearer who brought him the book ducats he believed the author was roger bacon the englishman on this point i suspend judgement it is your place to define for us what view we should take thereon to whose favor and kindness i unreservedly commit myself and remain at the command of your reverence joannes marcus marci of cronland prague th august or the dr raphael is believed to be raphael sobiehrd-mnishovsky and the sum of ducats is ozt kg of actual gold weight the only matching transaction in rudolf's records is the purchase of a couple of remarkable/rare books from karl widemann for the sum of florins widemann was a prolific collector of esoteric and alchemical manuscripts so his ownership of the manuscript is plausible but unproven while wilfrid voynich took raphael's claims at face value the bacon authorship theory has been largely discredited however a piece of evidence supporting rudolf's ownership is the now almost invisible name or signature on the first page of the book of jacobus horcicky de tepenecz the head of rudolf's botanical gardens in prague rudolf died still owing money to de tepenecz and it is possible that de tepenecz may have been given the book or simply taken it in partial payment of that debt no records of the book for the next years have been found but in all likelihood it was stored with the rest of kircher's correspondence in the library of the collegio romano now the pontifical gregorian university it probably remained there until the troops of victor emmanuel ii of italy captured the city in and annexed the papal states the new italian government decided to confiscate many properties of the church including the library of the collegio many books of the university's library were hastily transferred to the personal libraries of its faculty just before this happened according to investigations by xavier ceccaldi and others and those books were exempt from confiscation kircher's correspondence was among those books and so apparently was the voynich manuscript as it still bears the ex libris of petrus beckx head of the jesuit order and the university's rector at the time beckx's private library was moved to the villa mondragone frascati a large country palace near rome that had been bought by the society of jesus in and housed the headquarters of the jesuits ghislieri college in the society of jesus collegio romano was short of money and decided to sell some of its holdings discreetly to the vatican library the sale took place in but not all of the manuscripts listed for sale ended up going to the vatican wilfrid voynich acquired of these manuscripts among them the one which now bears his name he spent the next seven years attempting to interest scholars in deciphering the script while he worked to determine the origins of the manuscript in the manuscript was inherited after wilfrid's death by his widow ethel voynich author of the novel the gadfly and daughter of mathematician george boole she died in and left the manuscript to her close friend anne nill in nill sold the book to antique book dealer hans p kraus kraus was unable to find a buyer and donated the manuscript to yale university in where it was catalogued as ms sometimes also referred to as beinecke ms timeline of ownership the timeline of ownership of the voynich manuscript is given below the time when it was possibly created is shown in green early s based on carbon dating of the vellum periods of unknown ownership are indicated in white the commonly accepted owners of the th century are shown in orange the long period of storage in the collegio romano is yellow the location where wilfrid voynich allegedly acquired the manuscript frascati is shown in green late s voynich's ownership is shown in red and modern owners are highlighted blue authorship hypotheses many people have been proposed as possible authors of the voynich manuscript among them roger bacon john dee or edward kelley giovanni fontana and voynich early history marci's cover letter to kircher says that according to his friend the late raphael mnishovsky the book had once been bought by rudolf ii holy roman emperor and king of bohemia for ducats ozt kg of actual gold weight mnishovsky had died in more than years earlier and the deal must have occurred before rudolf's abdication in at least years before marci's letter however karl widemann sold books to rudolf ii in march according to the letter mnishovsky but not necessarily rudolf speculated that the author was th-century franciscan friar and polymath roger bacon marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim but it was taken quite seriously by wilfrid voynich who did his best to confirm it voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was albertus magnus if not roger bacon the assumption that bacon was the author led voynich to conclude that john dee sold the manuscript to rudolf dee was a mathematician and astrologer at the court of queen elizabeth i of england who was known to have owned a large collection of bacon's manuscripts dee and his scrier spirit medium edward kelley lived in bohemia for several years where they had hoped to sell their services to the emperor however this sale seems quite unlikely according to john schuster because dee's meticulously kept diaries do not mention it if bacon did not create the voynich manuscript a supposed connection to dee is much weakened it was thought possible prior to the carbon dating of the manuscript that dee or kelley might have written it and spread the rumour that it was originally a work of bacon's in the hopes of later selling it fabrication by voynich some suspect voynich of having fabricated the manuscript himself as an antique book dealer he probably had the necessary knowledge and means and a lost book by roger bacon would have been worth a fortune furthermore baresch's letter and marci's letter only establish the existence of a manuscript not that the voynich manuscript is the same one mentioned these letters could possibly have been the motivation for voynich to fabricate the manuscript assuming that he was aware of them however many consider the expert internal dating of the manuscript and the june discovery of baresch's letter to kircher as having eliminated this possibility eamon duffy says that the radiocarbon dating of the parchment or more accurately vellum effectively rules out any possibility that the manuscript is a post-medieval forgery as the consistency of the pages indicates origin from a single source and it is inconceivable that a quantity of unused parchment comprising at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins could have survived from the early th century giovanni fontana it has been suggested that some illustrations in the books of an italian engineer giovanni fontana slightly resemble voynich illustrations fontana was familiar with cryptography and used it in his books although he did not use the voynich script but a simple substitution cipher in the book secretum de thesauro experimentorum ymaginationis hominum secret of the treasure-room of experiments in man's imagination written c fontana described mnemonic machines written in his cypher that book and his bellicorum instrumentorum liber both used a cryptographic system described as a simple rational cipher based on signs without letters or numbers other theories sometime before voynich was able to read a name faintly written at the foot of the manuscript's first page jacobj tepenece this is taken to be a reference to jakub hořčick of tepenec also known by his latin name jacobus sinapius rudolf ii had ennobled him in had appointed him his imperial distiller and had made him curator of his botanical gardens as well as one of his personal physicians voynich and many other people after him concluded that jacobus owned the voynich manuscript prior to baresch and he drew a link from that to rudolf's court in confirmation of mnishovsky's story jacobus's name has faded further since voynich saw it but is still legible under ultraviolet light it does not match the copy of his signature in a document located by jan hurych in as a result it has been suggested that the signature was added later possibly even fraudulently by voynich himself baresch's letter bears some resemblance to a hoax that orientalist andreas müller once played on athanasius kircher müller sent some unintelligible text to kircher with a note explaining that it had come from egypt and asking him for a translation kircher reportedly solved it it has been speculated that these were both cryptographic tricks played on kircher to make him look foolish raphael mnishovsky the friend of marci who was the reputed source of the bacon story was himself a cryptographer and apparently invented a cipher which he claimed was uncrackable c this has led to the speculation that mnishovsky might have produced the voynich manuscript as a practical demonstration of his cipher and made baresch his unwitting test subject indeed the disclaimer in the voynich manuscript cover letter could mean that marci suspected some kind of deception in his book nick pelling proposed that the voynich manuscript was written by th-century north italian architect antonio averlino also known as filarete a theory broadly consistent with the radiocarbon dating language hypotheses many hypotheses have been developed about the voynich manuscript's language called voynichese ciphers according to the letter-based cipher theory the voynich manuscript contains a meaningful text in some european language that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the voynich manuscript alphabet through a cipher of some sort—an algorithm that operated on individual letters this was the working hypothesis for most th-century deciphering attempts including an informal team of nsa cryptographers led by william f friedman in the early s the counterargument is that almost all cipher systems consistent with that era fail to match what is seen in the voynich manuscript for example simple substitution ciphers would be excluded because the distribution of letter frequencies does not resemble that of any known language while the small number of different letter shapes used implies that nomenclator and homophonic ciphers should be ruled out because these typically employ larger cipher alphabets polyalphabetic ciphers were invented by alberti in the s and included the later vigenère cipher but they usually yield ciphertexts where all cipher shapes occur with roughly equal probability quite unlike the language-like letter distribution which the voynich manuscript appears to have however the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the voynich manuscript such as or ar ol al an ain aiin air aiir am ee eee among others does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a verbose cipher where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters for example the first two lines of page f15v seen above contain oror or and or or oro r which strongly resemble how roman numerals such as ccc or xxxx would look if verbosely enciphered shorthand in joseph martin feely claimed that the manuscript was a scientific diary written in shorthand according to d'imperio this was latin but in a system of abbreviated forms not considered acceptable by other scholars who unanimously rejected his readings of the text steganography this theory holds that the text of the voynich manuscript is mostly meaningless but contains meaningful information hidden in inconspicuous details—e.g the second letter of every word or the number of letters in each line this technique called steganography is very old and was described by johannes trithemius in though the plain text was speculated to have been extracted by a cardan grille an overlay with cut-outs for the meaningful text of some sort this seems somewhat unlikely because the words and letters are not arranged on anything like a regular grid still steganographic claims are hard to prove or disprove because stegotexts can be arbitrarily hard to find it has been suggested that the meaningful text could be encoded in the length or shape of certain pen strokes natural language statistical analysis of the text reveals patterns similar to those of natural languages for instance the word entropy about bits per word is similar to that of english or latin texts amancio et al argued that the voynich manuscript is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts building on this theory deep learning analysis conducted in determined that the alphabet was strikingly similar to khojiki script the linguist jacques guy once suggested that the voynich manuscript text could be some little-known natural language written plaintext with an invented alphabet he suggested chinese in jest but later comparison of word length statistics with vietnamese and chinese made him view that hypothesis seriously in many language families of east and central asia mainly sino-tibetan chinese tibetan and burmese austroasiatic vietnamese khmer etc and possibly tai thai lao etc morphemes generally have only one syllable child a linguist of indo-european languages for the u.s national security agency proposed that the manuscript was written in a hitherto unknown north germanic dialect he identified in the manuscript a skeletal syntax several elements of which are reminiscent of certain germanic languages while the content is expressed using a great deal of obscurity in february professor stephen bax of the university of bedfordshire made public his research into using bottom up methodology to understand the manuscript his method involved looking for and translating proper nouns in association with relevant illustrations in the context of other languages of the same time period a paper he posted online offers tentative translation of characters and words he suggested the text is a treatise on nature written in a natural language rather than a code but no further work has been done since bax's death in tucker talbert published a paper claiming a positive identification of plants animals and one mineral referenced in the manuscript to plant drawings in the libellus de medicinalibus indorum herbis or badianus manuscript an aztec herbal written in together with the presence of atacamite in the paint they argue that the plants were from colonial new spain and the text represented nahuatl the language of the aztecs they date the manuscript to between the date of the spanish conquest of the aztec empire and circa these dates contradict the earlier radiocarbon date of the vellum and other elements of the manuscript however they argued that the vellum could have been stored and used at a later date the analysis has been criticised by other voynich manuscript researchers who argued that a skilled forger could construct plants that coincidentally have a passing resemblance to theretofore undiscovered existing plants nahuatl specialist m.p hansen has rejected their proposed readings as pure nonsense constructed language the peculiar internal structure of voynich manuscript words led william f friedman to conjecture that the text could be a constructed language in friedman asked the british army officer john tiltman to analyse a few pages of the text but tiltman did not share this conclusion in a paper in brigadier tiltman said after reading my report mr friedman disclosed to me his belief that the basis of the script was a very primitive form of synthetic universal language such as was developed in the form of a philosophical classification of ideas by bishop wilkins in and dalgarno a little later it was clear that the productions of these two men were much too systematic and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable my analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution the concept of a constructed language is quite old as attested by john wilkins's philosophical language but still postdates the generally accepted origin of the voynich manuscript by two centuries in most known examples categories are subdivided by adding suffixes fusional languages as a consequence a text in a particular subject would have many words with similar prefixes—for example all plant names would begin with similar letters and likewise for all diseases etc this feature could then explain the repetitive nature of the voynich text however no one has been able yet to assign a plausible meaning to any prefix or suffix in the voynich manuscript hoax the fact that the manuscript has defied decipherment thus far has led various scholars to propose that the text does not contain meaningful content in the first place implying that it may be a medieval hoax in computer scientist gordon rugg showed that text with characteristics similar to the voynich manuscript could have been produced using a table of word prefixes stems and suffixes which would have been selected and combined by means of a perforated paper overlay the latter device known as a cardan grille was invented around as an encryption tool more than years after the estimated creation date of the voynich manuscript some maintain that the similarity between the pseudo-texts generated in gordon rugg's experiments and the voynich manuscript is superficial and the grille method could be used to emulate any language to a certain degree in april a study by austrian researcher andreas schinner published in cryptologia supported the hoax hypothesis schinner posited that the statistical properties of the manuscript's text were more consistent with meaningless gibberish produced using a quasi-stochastic method such as the one described by rugg than with latin and medieval german texts some scholars have claimed that the manuscript's text appears too sophisticated to be a hoax in marcelo montemurro a theoretical physicist from the university of manchester published findings claiming that semantic networks exist in the text of the manuscript such as content-bearing words occurring in a clustered pattern or new words being used when there was a shift in topic with this evidence he believes it unlikely that these features were intentionally incorporated into the text to make a hoax more realistic as most of the required academic knowledge of these structures did not exist at the time the voynich manuscript would have been written in researchers at yale university using the tf–idf analysis further investigated the relation between clusters of subjects in the text and topics as they could be identified by illustrations and paleography analysis their conclusion is that clusters derived by computation match with the topics of the illustrations to some degree thus providing evidence that the voynich manuscript contains meaningful text however other scholars have argued that such sophisticated patterns could also appear in hoaxed documents in gordon rugg and gavin taylor published another article in cryptologia demonstrating that the grille method could reproduce many larger-scale features of the text in torsten timm and andreas schinner published a paper arguing that the text was produced by a process of self-citation in which scribes copied and modified meaningless words from earlier in the text using a computer simulation of this process they demonstrated that it could reproduce many of the statistical characteristics of the voynich manuscript in yale university researchers daniel gaskell and claire bowern published the results of an experiment in which human participants intentionally tried to write meaningless text they found that the resulting text was often highly non-random and exhibited many of the same unusual statistical properties as the voynich manuscript supporting the idea that some features of the text could have been produced in a hoax glossolalia in their book gerry kennedy and rob churchill suggest the possibility that the voynich manuscript may be a case of glossolalia speaking-in-tongues channelling or outsider art if so the author felt compelled to write large amounts of text in a manner which resembles stream of consciousness either because of voices heard or because of an urge this often takes place in an invented language in glossolalia usually made up of fragments of the author's own language although invented scripts for this purpose are rare kennedy and churchill use hildegard von bingen's works to point out similarities between the voynich manuscript and the illustrations that she drew when she was suffering from severe bouts of migraine which can induce a trance-like state prone to glossolalia prominent features found in both are abundant streams of stars and the repetitive nature of the nymphs in the balneological section the theory is controversial and it is virtually impossible to prove or disprove it short of deciphering the text kennedy and churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis but consider it plausible in the culminating chapter of their work kennedy states his belief that it is a hoax or forgery churchill acknowledges the possibility that the manuscript is either a synthetic forgotten language as advanced by friedman or else a forgery as the preeminent theory however he concludes that if the manuscript is a genuine creation mental illness or delusion seems to have affected the author decipherment claims since the manuscript's modern rediscovery in there have been a number of claimed decipherings william romaine newbold one of the earliest efforts to decode the book's code was made in by william romaine newbold of the university of pennsylvania his singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless but that each apparent letter is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings discernible only under magnification these markings were supposed to be based on ancient greek shorthand forming a second level of script that held the real content of the writing newbold claimed to have used this knowledge to work out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of bacon and recording his use of a compound microscope four hundred years before van leeuwenhoek a circular drawing in the astronomical section depicts an irregularly shaped object with four curved arms which newbold interpreted as a picture of a galaxy which could be obtained only with a telescope however newbold's analysis has since been dismissed as overly speculative after john matthews manly of the university of chicago pointed out serious flaws in his theory for example each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations and as a result there was no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case newbold's method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible latin was produced these factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be discerned from the microscopic markings although evidence of micrography using the hebrew language can be traced as far back as the ninth century it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes newbold made out close study of the manuscript revealed the markings to be artefacts caused by the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum perceiving significance in these artefacts can be attributed to pareidolia thanks to manly's thorough refutation the micrography theory is now generally disregarded joseph martin feely in joseph martin feely published roger bacon's cipher the right key found in which he claimed that the book was a scientific diary written by roger bacon feely's method posited that the text was a highly abbreviated medieval latin written in a simple substitution cipher leonell c strong leonell c strong a cancer research scientist and amateur cryptographer believed that the solution to the voynich manuscript was a peculiar double system of arithmetical progressions of a multiple alphabet strong published a translation of two pages in and claimed that the plaintext revealed the voynich manuscript to be written by the th-century english author anthony ascham whose works include a little herbal published in notes released after his death reveal that the last stages of his analysis in which he selected words to combine into phrases were questionably subjective robert s brumbaugh in robert brumbaugh a professor of classical and medieval philosophy at yale university claimed that the manuscript was a forgery intended to fool emperor rudolf ii into purchasing it and that the text is latin enciphered with a complex two-step method john stojko in john stojko published letters to god's eye in which he claimed that the voynich manuscript was a series of letters written in vowelless ukrainian the theory caused some sensation among the ukrainian diaspora at the time and then in independent ukraine after however the date stojko gives for the letters the lack of relation between the text and the images and the general looseness in the method of decryption have all been criticised stephen bax in applied linguistics professor stephen bax self-published a paper proposing a provisional partial decoding of the voynich manuscript proposing a translation for ten proper nouns and fourteen letters from the manuscript using techniques similar to those used to successfully translate egyptian hieroglyphs he claimed the manuscript to be a treatise on nature in a near eastern or asian language but no full translation was made before bax's death in nicholas gibbs in september television writer nicholas gibbs claimed to have decoded the manuscript as idiosyncratically abbreviated latin he declared the manuscript to be a mostly plagiarised guide to women's health despite initial excitement in the community surrounding gibbs theory scholars judged gibbs hypothesis to be unoriginal his work was criticised as patching together already-existing scholarship with a highly speculative and incorrect translation lisa fagin davis director of the medieval academy of america stated that gibbs decipherment doesn't result in latin that makes sense davis added that she was surprised the tls published it other researchers concurred greg kondrak greg kondrak a professor of natural language processing at the university of alberta and his graduate student bradley hauer used computational linguistics in an attempt to decode the manuscript their findings were presented at the annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics in in the form of an article suggesting that the language of the manuscript is most likely hebrew but encoded using alphagrams i.e alphabetically ordered anagrams however the team admitted that experts in medieval manuscripts who reviewed the work were not convinced ahmet ard in ahmet ard an electrical engineer with an interest in turkic languages claimed in a youtube video that the voynich script is a kind of old turkic written in a poetic style the text would then be written using phonemic orthography meaning the author spelled out words as they heard them ard claimed to have deciphered and translated over of the manuscript his submission to the journal digital philology was rejected in gerard cheshire in gerard cheshire a biology research assistant at the university of bristol made headlines for his theory that the manuscript was written in a calligraphic proto-romance language he claimed to have deciphered the manuscript in two weeks using a combination of lateral thinking and ingenuity cheshire has suggested that the manuscript is a compendium of information on herbal remedies therapeutic bathing and astrological readings that it contains numerous descriptions of medicinal plants and passages that focus on female physical and mental health reproduction and parenting and that the manuscript is the only known text written in proto-romance he further claimed the manuscript was compiled by dominican nuns as a source of reference for maria of castile queen of aragon in june cheshire published his translation of the foldout illustration on page he claims that it depicts a volcano and theorises that it places the manuscript's creators near the island of vulcano which was an active volcano during the th century however experts in medieval documents disputed this interpretation vigorously with the executive director of the medieval academy of america lisa fagin davis denouncing the paper as just more aspirational circular self-fulfilling nonsense approached for comment by ars technica davis gave this explanation as with most would-be voynich interpreters the logic of this proposal is circular and aspirational he starts with a theory about what a particular series of glyphs might mean usually because of the word's proximity to an image that he believes he can interpret he then investigates any number of medieval romance-language dictionaries until he finds a word that seems to suit his theory then he argues that because he has found a romance-language word that fits his hypothesis his hypothesis must be right his translations from what is essentially gibberish an amalgam of multiple languages are themselves aspirational rather than being actual translations the university of bristol subsequently removed a reference to cheshire's claims from its website

arts nor the centre for medieval studies facsimiles many books and articles have been written about the manuscript copies of the manuscript pages were made by alchemist georgius barschius the

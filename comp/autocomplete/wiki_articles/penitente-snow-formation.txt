penitentes or nieves penitentes spanish for penitent snows are snow formations found at high altitudes they take the form of elongated thin blades of hardened snow or ice closely spaced and pointing towards the general direction of the sun the name comes from the resemblance of a field of penitentes to a crowd of kneeling people doing penance the formation evokes the tall pointed habits and hoods worn by brothers of religious orders in the processions of penance during spanish holy week in particular the brothers hats are tall narrow and white with a pointed top these spires of snow and ice grow over all glaciated and snow-covered areas in the dry andes above metres ft they range in length from a few centimetres to over metres ft first description penitentes were first described in scientific literature by charles darwin in on march he had to squeeze his way through snowfields covered in penitentes near the piuquenes pass on the way from santiago de chile to the argentine city of mendoza and reported the local belief continuing to the present day that they were formed by the strong winds of the andes formation penitentes are tall thin blades of hardened snow sculpted by the sun as the sun hits the snow it transforms it directly into vapor without melting it through a process called sublimation the ice vaporizes without turning into a liquid first initially smooth the snow surface thus develops depressions hills and hollows as some regions sublimate faster than others as the carved surfaces then continue to concentrate the sunlight they help to speed up the process this results in icy snow columns that look like towering spikes louis lliboutry noted that the key climatic condition behind the differential ablation that leads to the formation of penitentes is a dew point that remains below freezing this combined with dry air will cause snow to sublimate a mathematical model of the process has been developed by betterton although the physical processes at the initial stage of penitente growth from granular snow to micropenitentes still remain unclear the effect of penitentes on the energy balance of the snow surface and therefore their effect on snow melt and water resources has also been studied non-terrestrial penitentes up to metres ft high are suggested to be present in the tropics zone on europa a satellite of jupiter according to a study nasa's new horizons mission discovered penitentes hundreds of meters high on pluto likely composed primarily of methane ice deposited seasonally from pluto's thin atmosphere the structures occupy a region named tartarus dorsa a name that was formally accepted by the iau in august see also hoar frost rime ice stone forest suncup snow references further reading bergeron vance berger charles betterton m d controlled irradiative formation of penitentes physical review letters pmid s2cid kotlyakov v m lebedeva i m nieve and ice penitentes their way of formation and indicative significance zeitschrift f√ºr gletscherkunde und glazialgeologie in german x describes appearance and formation of these ablation features with reference to those observed in eastern pamir ussk lliboutry l glaciers of the dry andes in williams r s j ferrigno j g eds satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world usgs-p1386i archived from the original on retrieved cite book work ignored help external links media related to ice and snow penitents at wikimedia commons spiky glaciers are slower to melt new scientist march

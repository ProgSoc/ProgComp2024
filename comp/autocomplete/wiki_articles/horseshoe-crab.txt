horseshoe crabs are marine and brackish water arthropods of the family limulidae and the only living members of the order xiphosura despite their name they are not true crabs or crustaceans they are chelicerates most closely related to arachnids such as spiders ticks and scorpions horseshoe crabs live primarily in and around shallow coastal waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms they are generally found in the intertidal zone at spring high tides they are eaten in some parts of asia and used as fishing bait in fertilizer and in science especially limulus amebocyte lysate which is used for the detection and quantification of bacterial endotoxins in recent years population declines have occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction and overharvesting tetrodotoxin may be present in one horseshoe crab species carcinoscorpius rotundicauda the fossil record of xiphosura goes back over million years to the ordovician period with the oldest representatives of the modern family limulidae dating to approximately million years ago during the early triassic as such the extant forms have been described as living fossils the last common ancestor of the four present species is estimated to have lived about million years ago in the cretaceous some molecular analyses have placed xiphosura within arachnida with a molecular analysis placing them as the sister group of ricinulei taxonomy the family name limulidae comes from the genus limulus from the word limulus in latin meaning askance or a little askew horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans but belong to a separate subphylum of the arthropods chelicerata horseshoe crabs are closely related to the extinct eurypterids sea scorpions which include some of the largest arthropods to have ever existed and the two may be sister groups other studies have placed eurypterids closer to the arachnids in a group called merostomata the enigmatic chasmataspidids are also thought to be closely related to the horseshoe crabs the earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the lower ordovician period roughly million years ago the limulidae are the only recent family of the order xiphosura and contains all four living species of horseshoe crabs carcinoscorpius rotundicauda the mangrove horseshoe crab found in south and southeast asia limulus polyphemus the atlantic or american horseshoe crab found along the

konservat-lagerstatten lebanon upper eocene domsen sands germany asia recent cladogram after lasmdell anatomy the entire body of the horseshoe crab is protected by a carapace which like the rest of the exoskeleton is unmineralized it has two compound lateral eyes each composed of about ommatidia plus a pair of median eyes that are able to detect both visible light and ultraviolet light a single parietal eye and a pair of rudimentary lateral eyes on the top the latter becomes functional just before the embryo hatches also a pair of ventral eyes is located near the mouth as well as a cluster of photoreceptors on the telson having relatively poor eyesight the animals have the largest rods and cones of any known animal about times the size of humans and their eyes are a million times more sensitive to light at night than during the day they use their chelicerae—a pair of small appendages—for moving food into the mouth the next five pairs of appendages the first of which are the pedipalps are used for locomotion ambulatory legs the mouth is located in the center of the legs whose bases are referred to as gnathobases and have the same function as jaws and help grind up food in extant species and other fossil xiphosurans e.g alanops their appendages are uniramous but in other related non-xiphosurid euchelicerates such as offacolus and dibasterium the appendages are biramous the pedipalps on a male change shape on their terminal molt becoming boxing glove-like claspers that are used for grasping the female during mating the last pair of legs for both males and females are the main legs used for pushing when walking on the ocean floor the remaining leg pairs have a weak claw at the tip lost legs or the telson tail may slowly regenerate and cracks in the body shell can heal behind its legs the horseshoe crab has book gills which exchange respiratory gases and are also occasionally used for swimming as in other arthropods a true endoskeleton is absent but the body does have an endoskeletal structure made up of cartilaginous plates that support the book gills growth females are about larger than males the smallest species is c rotundicauda and the largest is t tridentatus on average males of c rotundicauda are about centimetres inches long including a tail telson that is about cm in and their carapace prosoma is about cm in wide some southern populations in the yucatán peninsula of l polyphemus are somewhat smaller but otherwise this species is larger in the largest species t tridentatus females can reach as much as cm in long including their tail and up to kg lb in weight this is only about cm in longer than the largest females of l polyphemus and t gigas but roughly twice the weight the juveniles grow about larger with every molt until reaching adult size atlantic horseshoe crabs molt in late july diet horseshoe crabs are more often found on the ocean floor searching for worms and molluscs which are their main food they may also feed on crustaceans and even small fish foraging usually takes place at night gravel and sand particles are ingested to further grind up food in a gizzard before passing it into the stomach breeding during the breeding season spring and summer in the northeast u.s year-round in warmer locations or when the full moon rises horseshoe crabs migrate to shallow coastal waters the smaller male horseshoe crab clings to the back or opisthosoma of the larger female using specialized front claws and fertilizes the eggs as they are laid in the sand additional males called satellite males which are not attached to the female may surround the pair and have some success in fertilizing eggs young female horseshoe crabs can be identified by the lack of mating scars the female can lay between and eggs in batches of a few thousand at a time the eggs may be inseminated within to minutes in l polyphemus the eggs take about two weeks to hatch shore birds eat many of them before they hatch the larvae molt six times during the first year and annually after the first or years natural breeding of horseshoe crabs in captivity has proven to be difficult some evidence indicates that mating takes place only in the presence of the sand or mud in which the horseshoe crab's eggs were hatched it is not known with certainty what is in the sand that the crabs can sense or how they sense it artificial insemination and induced spawning have been done on a relatively large scale in captivity and eggs and juveniles collected from the wild are often raised to adulthood in captivity in order to preserve and ensure the continuous supply of the horseshoe crab a breeding centre was built in johor malaysia where the crabs are bred and released back into the ocean in thousands once every two years it is estimated to take around years before they are suitable for consumption relationships with humans blood harvesting horseshoe crabs use hemocyanin to carry oxygen through their blood their blood contains amebocytes which play a similar role to the white blood cells of vertebrates in defending the organism against pathogens amebocytes from the blood of l polyphemus are used to make limulus amebocyte lysate lal which is used for the detection of bacterial endotoxins in medical applications there is a high demand for the blood the harvest of which involves collecting and bleeding the animals and then releasing them back into the sea most of the animals survive the process mortality is correlated with both the amount of blood extracted from an individual animal and the stress experienced during handling and transportation estimates of mortality rates following blood harvesting vary from to approximately limulus are harvested annually for this purpose declining horseshoe crab populations on the east coast of the united states endanger certain bird species which feed upon their eggs bleeding may also prevent female horseshoe crabs from being able to spawn or decrease the number of eggs they are able to lay up to of an individual's blood is removed according to the biomedical industry although npr reported that it can deplete them of more than half their volume of blue blood the horseshoe crabs spend between one and three days away from the ocean before being returned as long as the gills stay moist they can survive on land for four days some scientists are skeptical that certain companies return their horseshoe crabs to the ocean at all instead suspecting them of selling the horseshoe crabs as fishing bait the harvesting of horseshoe crab blood in the pharmaceutical industry is in decline in kyushu university researchers discovered that the same test could be achieved by using isolated limulus clotting factor c rfc an enzyme found in lal as by using lal itself jeak ling ding a national university of singapore researcher patented a process for manufacturing rfc on may synthetic isolated rfc made via her patented process became available for the first time industry at first took little interest in the new product however as it was patent-encumbered not yet approved by regulators and sold by a single manufacturer lonza group in however hyglos gmbh also began manufacturing its own rfc product this combined with the acceptance of rfc by european regulators the comparable cost between lal and rfc and support from eli lilly and company which has committed to use rfc in lieu of lal is projected to all but end the practice of blood harvesting from horseshoe crabs in december a report of the us senate which encouraged the food and drug administration to establish processes for evaluating alternative pyrogenicity tests and report back to the senate on steps taken to increase their use was released peta backed the report in june it was reported that u.s pharmacopeia had declined to give rfc equal standing with horseshoe crab blood without the approval for the classification as an industry standard testing material u.s companies will have to overcome the scrutiny of showing that rfc is safe and effective for their desired uses which may serve as a deterrent for usage of the horseshoe crab blood substitute vaccine research and development during the covid pandemic has added additional strain on the american horseshoe crab in the u.s fish and wildlife service halted the harvesting of horseshoe crabs in the cape romain national wildlife refuge south carolina from march to july to aid their reproduction this decision was influenced by the importance of horseshoe crab eggs as a food source for migratory birds and the ongoing use of horseshoe crabs for bait and their blood in medical products the ban supports the conservation goals of the refuge spanning acres hectares of marshes beaches and islands near charleston fishery horseshoe crabs are used as bait to fish for eels mostly in the united states and whelk or conch nearly million crabs a year are harvested for bait in the united states dwarfing the biomedical mortality however fishing with horseshoe crab was banned indefinitely in new jersey in with a moratorium on harvesting to protect the red knot a shorebird which eats the crab's eggs a moratorium was restricted to male crabs in delaware and a permanent moratorium is in effect in south carolina the eggs are eaten in parts of southeast asia johor and china a low horseshoe crab population in the delaware bay is hypothesized to endanger the future of the red knot red knots long-distance migratory shorebirds feed on the protein-rich eggs during their stopovers on the beaches of new jersey and delaware an effort is ongoing to develop adaptive-management plans to regulate horseshoe crab harvests in the bay in a way that protects migrating shorebirds culinary use the population of t gigas in indonesia and malaysia has decreased dramatically in the past decade the harvesting of t gigas is largely used to supply thailand with primarily female t gigas which is considered a local delicacy this female harvesting has led to an unbalanced sex ratio in the wild which also contributes to its declining population in the area evolution phylogeny horseshoe crabs are the sister group to ricinuleids and are within the family arachnida classifying them as aquatic arachnids their aquatic nature is the result of a secondary shift to marine life following the initial shift to land by the common ancestor of all arachnids the radiation of horseshoe crabs occurred rapidly and resulted in total lineages of which only remain the atlantic species is sister to the three asian species the latter of which are likely the result of two divergences relatively close in time now-extinct horseshoe crabs traveled to land at least five times throughout history two of which resulted in the formation of a major clade these clades belinurina and austrolimulidae both inhabited marginally marine environments such as swamps and rivers which are both distinct from the habitats of the extant species which did not undergo the same transition to land morphological stasis as generalists horseshoe crabs can have a broad diet and live in diverse habitats meaning they are more likely to survive and produce viable offspring in more places horseshoe crabs also have an incredibly efficient immune system and can also be successful in areas with high concentrations of bacteria amoebocytes in the bloodstream attack bacterial cells and in doing so act as coagulants around the foreign body preventing them from multiplying this trait is an adaptation to their often bacteria-rich environment their ability to succeed in many environments limits selective forces as there are few if any mutations that would result in more beneficial alleles that would make horseshoe crabs more suited for survival in the atlantic horseshoe crab microrna’s exist on loci comparatively high to the loci in spiders and scorpions meaning horseshoe crabs have comparatively high rates of gene regulation which could contribute to their morphological status additionally several other gene clusters are present in at least and often loci whole genome duplication the common ancestor to arachnids underwent a whole genome duplication event which was likely followed by another duplication event in the common ancestor to the extant species of horseshoe crabs about million years ago and evidence points to two additional events having occurred since then however many of these ancient genes have likely undergone either neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization as a result of functional divergence meaning their expression is not the same as it was following the wgd event as seen in other chelicerate lineages evidence from genomic sequencing the genome assembly of two species of horseshoe crabs c rotundicauda and t tridentatus suggests a genome size of gb for both species the relatively large size of these genomes is believed to be another result of multiple rounds of whole genome duplication in c rotundicauda the number of hox genes is which mainly exist on five hox clusters there are hox genes on clusters in t tridentatus both species contain two parahox clusters the l polyphemus similarly contains hox clusters the evidence of at least hox clusters in these three species indicates at least two rounds of whole genome duplication homeobox genes are present in more than four copies furthermore most chromosomes in c rotinducauda exhibit synteny with between and chromosomes also indicating that at least two and likely rounds of whole genome duplication occurred in the common ancestor of the extant species between and million years ago many of the ancient genes present due to past whole genome duplication events have experienced ongoing mutations and as a result have become pseudogenes and lost their ability to code for proteins evidence for this phenomenon was found in a population of c rotundica in hong kong in which individuals sequenced exhibited deletion of the paralog of the unpg-a gene indicating an ongoing mutative process of pseudogenization in c rotundicauda sexual size dimorphism several hypotheses have been proposed as possible mechanisms for the size difference between male and female horseshoe crabs the sexual size dimorphism of horseshoe crabs that results in a larger average size in females than males is likely a result of the amalgamation of many different aspects of these hypotheses and more horseshoe crabs exhibit self-similar size preferences when choosing a mate inverse relationships in which the male is larger than the female are rare the maintenance of size difference in mating partners is likely in part a result of the stability of this self-similar preference and dimorphism mature females undergo an additional year of maturation and an additional molt to males a contributing factor in their larger average size to mature males larger female horseshoe crabs can house more eggs within their bodies and therefore pass on more genetic material than smaller females during each mating cycle satellite males found occupying the ideal mating position were found to be on average in better condition than those in other mating positions indicating a significant relationship between reproductive success and the male’s condition as satellite males account for nearly of fertilization there is no evidence of assortative mating indicating sexual selection is likely not the main factor in this sexual size dimorphism rather than favoring size selection favors the ability to switch to satellite behavior as individuals like these can contribute more genetic material to the next population which will increase the number of individuals with the ability to engage in both types of mating behaviors conservation status development along shorelines is dangerous to horseshoe crab spawning limiting available space and degrading habitat bulkheads can block access to intertidal spawning regions as well because of the destruction of habitat and shoreline development use in fishing plastic pollution status as a culinary delicacy in some areas and use for scientific research and advancements the horseshoe crab is facing down endangered and extinct statuses one species t tridentatus has already been declared extirpated from taiwan facing a greater than population decrease in t tridentatus juveniles it is suspected that hong kong will be the next to declare the horseshoe crab extirpated from its area the species is listed as endangered on the iucn red list specifically because of overexploitation and loss of critical habitat leading to a steep decline in population size references further reading chisholm h ed king-crab encyclopædia britannica th ed cambridge university press

# ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶Solar Powered Research Station
A remote Antarctic research station is being designed and solar cells are being considered as a method of powering the station. 
Given that:
* The station is set to be located at a **latitude of -76** (76Â° lower than the equator). 
* The Earth's equator is on a **23.5Â° axial tilt** from it's orbital plane. Assume that the orbital inclination is 0Â° and that the Earth's axis of rotation is leaning 23.5Â° directly away from the sun as shown in the diagram below. 
* A solar panel can be **rotated north and south by Â±15Â° from pointing straight up** with motors but doing so costs **1 joule per degree** of rotation.
* The panel outputs $\alpha\cos(\theta)$ watts (joules per second) where $\theta$ is the angle between the panel's normal vector and the sun and $\alpha$ is your question input.
* Assume that the Earth casts no shadow and it is always day. 
Find the maximum possible number of joules that can be generated in 1 day within Â±0.5 joules.

## Input
Your input is the $\alpha$ parameter of the solar cell.

## Output
Your output should be amount of energy generated in 1 day in joules.

# üè® Hotel Rooms
From a list of arrival and departure of hotel guests as timestamps **in seconds**, **allocate a room to each guest** given that each room **must be cleaned before a new guest can stay there**. The hotel's cleaning staff has **5 members** and each room takes **1 member 30 minutes (1800 seconds) to clean**. Each guest must have their own room. The hotel **only has 50 rooms** and your solution must not exceed this.

## Input
Each line of the input represents a guest's arrival time followed by their departure time separated by a comma in Unix seconds.

```
34733, 46231
35492, 53938
32985, 52534
23745, 32775
29162, 37479
24443, 36335
19190, 31646
12526, 30995
29457, 37768
35407, 43158
```

## Output
Your output should be a comma-separated list of room numbers **starting from 0** (whitespace is ignored) that corresponds to each line in the input in the order that they are given. The **maximum allowed room number in your answer is 49** as there are only 50 rooms.
```
0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6,
```

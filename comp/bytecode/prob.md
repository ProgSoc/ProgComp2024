# ðŸ“œ Bytecode Interpreter

"To know a computer, one must become a computer."
At least, that's what your manager said when they put this task on your desk.

Anyway. Time to read.
Apparently, someone has left behind a large list of instructions, in a certain kind of bytecode.

The interpreter reads this code line by line and performs each instruction's action as it goes.

There are 4 kinds of instructions encoded in this bytecode.
* `LABEL <int>` - This is a marker in the code that can be jumped to. It does not perform any actions.
  * For example, `LABEL 20` can be jumped to by a command like `JZ a 20`.
* `ADD <var> <int>` - Increase the value of variable `<var>` by `<int>`.
  This can be any integer (positive or negative).
  * For example, `ADD a 123` will add `123` to the existing value of the variable `a`,
    and put this value back into the variable `a`.
* `JZ <var> <int>` - If the value of variable `<var>` is `0`, jump to `LABEL <int>`.
  If it jumps to a non-existent label, the program ends.
  * For example, `JZ a 7` will jump to `LABEL 7` if the variable `a` currently contains the value of zero.
* `COPY <var1> <var2>` - Puts the value of `<var1>` into the variable `<var2>`.
  * For example, if `COPY a b` is executed when `a` has the value of `50`,
    then `b` will now also have the value `50`.

At the start of the program,
there are 5 integer variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`
that all initially have the value of `0`.

Right as your manager leaves,
a passing comment is made that the code you are given may pontentially contain an infinite loop,
and in such cases, you reckon that executing 5000 instructions should be enough.

Therefore, we seek to answer the question:
**Given a list of bytecode instructions,
after the program concludes execution,
or after 5000 instructions have been executed (whichever is faster),
what is the value contained in the variable `a`?**

## Example

```
LABEL 0
ADD a 1
JZ a 0
COPY a b
```

In the above example, the following sequence happens.
* `LABEL 0` - No action is taken, but this is where any `JZ <var> 0` instructions will redirect to.
* `ADD a 1` - The current value of `a` is `0` (initialised upon program start),
  and so `1` is added, giving `a` the new value of `1`.
* `JZ a 0` - The value of `a` (which is `1` currently) is tested against zero.
  Since it is not equal to zero, we do **not** jump to `LABEL 0`.
* `COPY a b` - The value of `a` is being put into `b`. Since `a` has `1` right now, `b` is now set to `1`.

**At the end of executing these instructions, `a` has the value of `1`.**

## Input
Your input will be a list of bytecode instructions.
Each instruction will be on a new line, and
the operands of the instruction will be separated by spaces, as per the example above.

### Constraints

* All variables are within the signed 64-bit integer limit.
* All `LABEL` numbers are non-negative integers.
* There are only five variables: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.

## Output
Your output should be a single integer: the value of variable `a` after the program has finished executing
(or 5000 instructions have been executed, whichever happens first).

For the example above, the output will be the following.
```
1
